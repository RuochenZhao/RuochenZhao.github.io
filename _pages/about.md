I'm a Ph.D. candidate at Nanyang Technological University ([NTU-NLP](https://ntunlpsg.github.io/)), advised by Associate Professor [Shafiq Joty](https://raihanjoty.github.io/). I am currently focusing on the topic of NLP interpretability, with interests in **large language models, causal inference, and reasoning**. Specifically, I am intrigued by the research question of endowing LLMs with reasoning abilities by mimicing human thinking processes. **I'm actively seeking internships related to LLM research for the year 2024.**

Prior to my Ph.D. journey, I received my B.S. in Mathematics from Courant Institute, New York University. I then graduated with an M.S. in Data Science from Harvard University. After spending 6 years in the U.S., I returned to Asia and have been staying in Singapore for 2 years.

Outside of schoolwork, I love to travel and spent half a year in Florence, Italy. I enjoy reading novels and philosophy. To relieve stress, I cook and play the piano. My Chinese name is 赵若辰, which translates to "like a star".
