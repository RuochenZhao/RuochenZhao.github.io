I'm a Ph.D. candidate at Nanyang Technological University ([NTU-NLP](https://ntunlpsg.github.io/)), advised by Associate Professor [Shafiq Joty](https://raihanjoty.github.io/). I am currently focusing on the topic of NLP interpretability, with interests in large language models, causal inference, and reasoning.

Prior to my Ph.D. journey, I studied Mathematics at Courant Institute, New York University for undergraduate. I then joined Harvard University in pursuing a master's degree in Data Science. After spending 6 years in the U.S., I returned to Asia and have been staying in Singapore for 2 years.

Outside of schoolwork, I love to travel and spent half a year in Florence, Italy. I enjoy reading novels and philosophy. To relieve stress, I cook and play the piano. My Chinese name is 赵若辰, which translates to "like a star".
